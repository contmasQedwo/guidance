But what if you want to play Supaplex on your modern computer or laptop? The original game was designed for MS-DOS and it might not run well on newer operating systems. Moreover, you might not want to install the game on your hard drive or pay for it. That's where the Supaplex Complete Bundle comes in handy.
 
The Supaplex Complete Bundle is a collection of four versions of Supaplex: the original game, the SpeedFix version that fixes some bugs and glitches, the MegaFix version that adds new features and levels, and the Level Collection version that includes hundreds of fan-made levels. The best part is that all these versions are portable, which means you can run them from a USB stick or any other removable device without installing anything on your computer.
 
But how can you get the Supaplex Complete Bundle for free? The answer is simple: by downloading it from a torrent site. Torrents are files that contain information about other files that are shared by users over the internet. By using a torrent client, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent, you can download the files you want from other users who have them.
 
However, before you download anything from a torrent site, you should be aware of some risks and precautions. First of all, downloading copyrighted content without permission is illegal and can get you in trouble with the law. Secondly, some torrent files might contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Thirdly, some torrent sites might be blocked or censored by your internet service provider or government.
 
Therefore, if you decide to download the Supaplex Complete Bundle from a torrent site, you should do it at your own risk and responsibility. You should also use a VPN (virtual private network) service to hide your IP address and encrypt your traffic, and an antivirus software to scan the files before opening them.
 
With that said, here are the steps to download the Supaplex Complete Bundle from a torrent site:
 
1. Go to a torrent site that has the Supaplex Complete Bundle file. You can use a search engine like Google or Bing to find one, or use a torrent aggregator like Torrentz2 or 1337x. For example, we found this link on 1337x: [https://1337x.to/torrent/4898429/Supaplex-Complete-Bundle-Portable-Edition/](https://1337x.to/torrent/4898429/Supaplex-Complete-Bundle-Portable-Edition/)
2. Download the torrent file or copy the magnet link. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about the larger file you want to download. A magnet link is a URL that does the same thing without requiring a torrent file. You can choose either option depending on your preference and torrent client.
3. Open the torrent file or paste the magnet link in your torrent client. This will start the download process. You will see the progress and speed of the download in your torrent client. You can also pause or resume the download at any time.
4. Wait until the download is complete. Depending on the size of the file and the number of seeders (users who have the complete file and share it with others) and leechers (users who are downloading the file), this might take from a few minutes to several hours.
5. Open the downloaded folder and extract the files. The Supaplex Complete Bundle file is compressed in a ZIP format, which means you need to unzip it before using it. You can use any software that can handle ZIP files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
6. Run the Supaplex.exe file from any of the four folders (Original, SpeedFix, MegaFix, Level Collection) depending on which version of Supaplex you want to play. You can also copy the folders to any removable device and play them from there.
